# 401 Advanced Javascript

## Course Overview

> Javascript 401 is a full stack exploration using Express and React as the primary delivery mechanisms. Students will be learning high level engineering principles through developing applications and libraries over the course of 8 Modules, extending over 2 sections

### The first half of the course (the "Backend Section") is made up of 4 modules focusing on the server side, using NodeJS and Express

- Data Modeling
- Express API Server
- Authentication and Authorization
- Realtime (Sockets, Messages, Queuing)

### The second half of the course (the "Frontend Section") is comprised of 4 modules, focused on React

- React Basics / Component Based Design
- Hooks and Context
- Redux
- React Native and other Frameworks

## Getting started as a Facilitator/Instructor

1. Finish reading this document
1. Read the information in the `/facilitator` folder to get a sense of how the course is structured and what's being taught each day
1. Set up your class using the script in the `/facilitator/setup` folder
1. Browse the `/curriculum`, focusing on the `/facilitator` folders to get an idea of what's being taught each day

## Prepping for a day

> In each `class-##` of the curriculum folder you'll find the resources you need to teach a given day

1. Read the student facing README and DISCUSSION to see what information your students are being given access to before your lecture
1. Read the `facilitator/README.md` to get a sense of what information you'll need to cover and in what order
1. Refer to any images or sample lecture and/presentation slides given
1. Run the demo so you know what you'll need to code live
1. Run the solution so you know what the students will need to produce in lab

### A quick tour of this repository

- `/_layouts`, `assets`, `_config.yml`
  - These are for formatting the README.md files in the course for canvas. You may ignore these.

- `/apps-and-libraries`
  - Fully functional (final) versions of each of the projects the students will be building throughout the course
  - These should serve as a good reference point for demonstrating what the students will learn and should be able to take with them
  - Feel free to share these with the students at the completion of each module / section

- `/configs`
  - Contains basic application configuration files (.gitignore, .eslintrc.json, etc) that are approved for use by the students and instructors for use in application building
  - These should be the default files used when starting new application development or lab work

- `/curriculum`
  - The folders within represent each day of the course
  - Within each folder, you'll find the following information
    - `/README.md` - The student facing "readme" for the day, which summarizes their day
    - `/DISCUSSION.md` - The reading material and assignment for the students for the day
    - `/demo` - A working demo for the instructor to perform/deliver to the students
    - `/facilitator` - A folder containing the day's content for the instructor (Lecture Overviews, Demo Instructions, etc)
    - `/lab` - The student's lab assignment and any starter code prepared for them
    - `/solution` - A possible solution for the lab assignment, to assist with grading, code review and lab execution

- `/facilitator`
  - A high level overview of the course and each Module, for the instructor
  - Contains detailed information about the goals and progressions for each Module

- `/extra-content`
  - Contains content from previous runs of the course, proposed classes, extra lectures, etc
  - If you have an idea for new material, add it here
  - If you want to pull in something "random" to an open day, this is a good source of lecture material on a variety of subjects

- `/reference`
  - Reference materials for the students
  - "How To" guides on lab submissions
  - Cheatsheets
  - Post-graduate work ideas, interview prep guides, etc.
